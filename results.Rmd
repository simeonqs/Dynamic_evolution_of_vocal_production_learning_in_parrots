We scored the vocal mimicry ability of `r length(tree$tip.label)` species (for the full distribution see Figure 1). `r sum(dat$vocal)` of showed at least one mimic. [Do we want to say something about the ancestral state reconstrution depicted in Figure 1?]

Colours represent the ancestral state reconstruction of vocal mimicry ranging from blue = no vocal mimicry detected to red = vocal mimicry detected.](/Users/ssmeele/ownCloud/Simeon/MPI%20AB/Side%20projects/Parrort%20mimicry/parrot_mimicry/ANALYSIS/RESULTS/tree%20mimicry%20or%20not.pdf)

We ran four models to test the total effect of longevity, relative brain size, sociality and body size on the probability that a species can mimic. All variables had a positive total effect, although the effect of relative brain size was highly uncertain (see Figure 2).

Lefthand side: posterior densities of the effect of longevity (red), relative brain size (green), gregariousness (blue) and body size (orange). For gregariousness the contrast between a non-gregarious and a gregarious species is shown. For all other variables the slope is shown.

We recorded the number of unique mimics that an individual produced for `r nrow(dat_long)` individuals across `r length(unique(dat_long$species))` species. We ran four models to test the total effect of longevity, relative brain size, sociality and body size on the number of unique mimics that an individual produced in a video. Longevity had no effect, relative brain size had a highly uncertain effect, while sociality and body size had a small positive effect (see Figure 3).

We also tested the influence of the four variable on the unique number of words an individual produced in a video (see Figure 4). Longevity had a clear total effect. Relative brain size had no clear effect. Sociality and body size had a small and uncertain effect.
