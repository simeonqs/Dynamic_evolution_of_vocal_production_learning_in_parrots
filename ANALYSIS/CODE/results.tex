\maketitle

We scored the vocal mimicry ability of 398 species (for the full
distribution see Figure 1). 137 of showed at least one mimic. {[}Do we
want to say something about the ancestral state reconstrution depicted
in Figure 1?{]}

\caption{Phylogenetic tree of all parrots species for which vocal
mimicry was assessed. Colours represent the ancestral state
reconstruction of vocal mimicry ranging from blue = no vocal mimicry
detected to red = vocal mimicry detected.}
\end{figure}

We ran four models to test the total effect of longevity, relative brain
size, sociality and body size on the probability that a species can
mimic. All variables had a positive total effect, although the effect of
relative brain size was highly uncertain (see Figure 2).

gregarious species is shown. For all other variables the slope is shown.

We recorded the number of unique mimics that an individual produced for
843 individuals across 136 species. We ran four models to test the total
effect of longevity, relative brain size, sociality and body size on the
number of unique mimics that an individual produced in a video.
Longevity had no effect, relative brain size had a highly uncertain
effect, while sociality and body size had a small positive effect (see
Figure 3).

\end{figure}

We also tested the influence of the four variable on the unique number
of words an individual produced in a video (see Figure 4). Longevity had
a clear total effect. Relative brain size had no clear effect. Sociality
and body size had a small and uncertain effect.
